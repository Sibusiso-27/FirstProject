# EurOrbit -> My First Ever Weather Forecast Project!
This is my first full-stack weather web app!
EurOrbit lets you pick a European city and instantly see a 7-day weather forecast, complete with animated icons, high/low temps, and real time updates using the 7Timer! API. Itâ€™s built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and even reads CSV data for city coordinates.
From dropdown selection to loading spinners and GIF weather vibes, this project marks my first step into real world web development, and I'm just getting started
